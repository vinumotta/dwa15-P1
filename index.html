		<h2>Describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>I am a Mobile Engineer, working for a company called MeYou Health. MYH develops well being products which provide health interventions (free to use :) ). I am working on implementing the mobile applications for the respective products (iOS + Android). </p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I am taking this course just to learn more about web applications. Even getting to this point of completing this assignment has been a lot of fun - learning a ton of things.</p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have been working for 3 years on mobile applications, and I have taken various computer science courses back in college. Most of my experience has been non-Web based, embedded systems, distributed, C, C++, Java, and mobile.</p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>Working on a Mac (only since it is essentially required for iOS development). But I try to be pliable to any environment. Have a couple of linux machines which I use time to time.</p>
		
		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>I took a very introductory course last year about HTML, css, ajax. I am super green when it comes to anything web-related. I am hoping I can learn enough to make my own simple web-app and API's to serve client side applications</p>
